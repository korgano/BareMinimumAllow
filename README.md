PiHole v6 Allow List

An allow list built-up over time, so there might be things that need pruning. Focuses on getting retailers, Pluto TV/Tubi/Paramount+/YouTube streaming, and various stores and online apps working.

For example, `jnn-pa.googleapis.com` is necessary for YouTube to load videos properly.

No license, anyone is allowed to freely copy this information as part of their own allow lists.
